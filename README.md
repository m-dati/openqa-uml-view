This project is intended to provide a graphical representation of openQA SUSE test code using a metalanguage for UML diagrams generation, for planning and debugging purposes.

The openqa reference code is in <https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse>

In particular, the initial demo of the UML coding is a reverse engineering of some Perl subroutines for Public Cloud, in <https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse/blob/master/lib/main_publiccloud.pm>

The UML diagrams are used to represent the graphical view of the project, helping to identify the bugs and improve the logic inthe code.

Here we refer to the https://plantuml.com tool documentation.

Many web editor are available to represent the resulting images, like <https://plantuml.com/plantuml> or <https://www.planttext.com/>

But also an offline version of the UML interpreter is available using a jar file, get it from <https://plantuml.com/download> and use as explained in
<https://plantuml.com/faq-install>  and <https://plantuml.com/command-line>
